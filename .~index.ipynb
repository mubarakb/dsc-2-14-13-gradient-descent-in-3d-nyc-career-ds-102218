So as you can see, $\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x}f(1, 3) = -6$ as shown in the green line in the top left.  That's because when you move to that point on the graph, $(3, -1)$ and then nudge a little bit in the $x$ direction, the change in output is $-6$.

    "In this section, we have learned how to think about taking the partial derivative of a function.  For the partial derivative, we say we are taking the derivative with respect to a variable.  So for example, we can say for the function $f(x, y)$, take the partial derivative with respect to the variable $x$.  This means we are assessing the output after nudging in the $x$ direction, and we can express this as $\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x} $.  Our rule for taking the partial derivative is to treat the variables that we are not taking the derivative with respect to as constants.  Which makes sense, because at the time that we are taking the derivative by making our \"nudge\" the only variable that is changing is the variable we are taking the derivative with respect to."
